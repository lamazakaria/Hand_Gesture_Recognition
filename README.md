# Hand_Gesture_Recognition
Hand Gesture Recognition using Contours and LSTM

This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using contours extracted from images and classifying them using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately recognize different hand gestures from a sequence of images. The process involves:

1. **Contour Detection:** Extracting contours from each image to capture the shape and structure of the hand gesture.
2. **LSTM Model:** Using the extracted contours as input sequences to an LSTM model, which then classifies the gesture.
